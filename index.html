            <p class="w3-large">Years before the start of the play, near the start of the Trojan War, the Greek general Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigeneia in order to appease the goddess Artemis. While his sacrifice allowed the Greek army to set sail for Troy, it led to a deep resentment in his wife, Clytemnestra. Upon Agamemnon's return from the Trojan War ten years later, Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus murdered him.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">Context</h3>
            <p class="w3-large">Elderly advisors to the Persian court serve as the play’s chorus. Their king, Xerxes, has left to invade Greece with a mighty army, but has not returned. The chorus’s fears mount; the men worry alongside Xerxes’s frightened mother, learn terrible news from a messenger, and invoke Xerxes’s father, the great deceased King Darius, to rise from his tomb onstage. The advisors eventually meet the disgraced and defeated Xerxes upon his return, and together they mourn the devastation of Persia. More accurately, while the Persians lost decisively in this invasion (after, however, burning Athens), they did not lose their empire, as Aeschylus suggests. In fact, they remained a powerful force for generations.</p>

It is set before the palace of Agamemnon at Mycenae, where, years after his mother had killed his father, Orestes returns at the beginning of the play with his faithful friend Pylades and his loyal tutor (the Pedagogue), to whom his sister Electra had entrusted him soon after the murder of Agamemnon.</p>

            <p>This play mainly consists of dialogues between Eteocles, a Theban scout reporting from outside Thebes, and a Chorus of fearful Theban girls, regarding the ongoing attack of an Argive army led by Eteocles’ brother, Polynices. Both brothers claim right to the throne of Thebes, but, since Eteocles has refused to share it with Polynices, the latter decided to summon an army and attack Thebes.</p>

            <p>In The Suppliants, Danaus and his daughters disembark on the shore of Argos asking the local king Pelasgus for protection from their cousins, the sons of Aegyptus, who forcefully want to marry them. After some consultation with his people, Pelasgus agrees to shelter his guests, even though he knows that this would probably lead to a devastating war with Egypt. His worst fears come true after an Egyptian party arrives at the shore of Argos and threatens to come back with an army if Pelasgus doesn’t hand over them the Danaids. Once again, the king of Argos chooses war over betrayal.</p>

Led by a woman named Lysistrata, they occupy the Acropolis (with the object of denying Athens the financial resources to fight on) and launch a sex-strike as a way to enforce their husbands to negotiate peace.</p>

            <p>Peisetaerus (meaning “Persuader of his Comrades”) and Euelpides (“Son of Good Hope”) – two men fed up with the politics and law-courts of Athens – have fled the city and are in search of Tereus, who has, according to legend, turned into a hoopoe(bird of some sort) sometime in the past.

However, this proves a tricky endeavor. First, the two have problems convincing a corpse to help them with their luggage to the Underworld and then Dionysus has to row Charon’s boat in the Infernal Lake by himself, while an irritating chorus of frogs accompanies them with an onomatopoeic song.</p>

            <h3>The Knights</h3>
            <p>The play is essentially a violent attack on an Athenian general who had, two years earlier, accused Aristophanes before the Athenian Council of having ridiculed the institutions of his city in the presence of foreigners. The Athenian General, however, is mentioned only once by name and is rather transparently represented in the figure of Paphlagon, a newly-bought slave who has taken over the household of his gullible master Demos.</p>
